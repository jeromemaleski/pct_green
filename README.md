# pct_green_batch
This shiny app was created to batch process images into a green index.
Indexes avalible are "Green Leaf Index" (GLI) and "Visible Atmospherically Resistant Index" (VARI)
After creating an index you can then chose a threshold to evaluate percent green in the image.
A graph of image % green values and a table are created.
